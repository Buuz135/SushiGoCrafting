Sushi Go Crafting is a food mod where you make sushi with a small discovery minigame to get the perfect food and get
amazing food effects. It adds different types of Sushi to suit your needs with different combination of ingredients.

Each ingredient has a different effect or modifier effect and they get all combined when making a Sushi Roll so when you
eat you will recieve more than food/saturation.

Current Types Of Sushi:

    Maki
    Gunkan
    California
    Nigiri
    Onigiri
    Temaki

This mod adds worldgen for Avocado Trees and Seaweed, also adds Tuna and Shrimp into the ocean.

(It depends on Titanium, and requires JEI and Pathouli for a better experience)
